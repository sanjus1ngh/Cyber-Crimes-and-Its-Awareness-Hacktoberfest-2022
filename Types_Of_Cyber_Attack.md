A cyber-attack is an exploitation of computer systems and networks. It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft.

We are living in a digital era. Now a day, most of the people use computer and internet. Due to the dependency on digital things, the illegal computer activity is growing and changing like any type of crime.

Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories:

Web-based attacks
These are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of the important web-based attacks are as follows-

1. Injection attacks

It is the attack in which some data will be injected into a web application to manipulate the application and fetch the required information.

Example- SQL Injection, code Injection, log Injection, XML Injection etc.

2. DNS Spoofing

DNS Spoofing is a type of computer security hacking. Whereby a data is introduced into a DNS resolver's cache causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to the attacker?s computer or any other computer. The DNS spoofing attacks can go on for a long period of time without being detected and can cause serious security issues.

3. Session Hijacking

It is a security attack on a user session over a protected network. Web applications create cookies to store the state and user sessions. By stealing the cookies, an attacker can have access to all of the user data.

4. Phishing
Phishing is a type of attack which attempts to steal sensitive information like user login credentials and credit card number. It occurs when an attacker is masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.

5. Brute force

It is a type of attack which uses a trial and error method. This attack generates a large number of guesses and validates them to obtain actual data like user password and personal identification number. This attack may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by security, analysts to test an organization's network security.

6. Denial of Service

It is an attack which meant to make a server or network resource unavailable to the users. It accomplishes this by flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a crash. It uses the single system and single internet connection to attack a server. It can be classified into the following-
  Volume-based attacks- Its goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and is measured in bit per second.

  Protocol attacks- It consumes actual server resources, and is measured in a packet. 

  Application layer attacks- Its goal is to crash the web server and is measured in request per second.
 
7. Dictionary attacks

This type of attack stored the list of a commonly used password and validated them to get original password.

8. URL Interpretation

It is a type of attack where we can change the certain parts of a URL, and one can make a web server to deliver web pages for which he is not authorized to browse.

9. File Inclusion attacks

It is a type of attack that allows an attacker to access unauthorized or essential files which is available on the web server or to execute malicious files on the web server by making use of the include functionality.

10. Man in the middle attacks

It is a type of attack that allows an attacker to intercepts the connection between client and server and acts as a bridge between them. Due to this, an attacker will be able to read, insert and modify the data in the intercepted connection.

System-based attacks
These are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. Some of the important system-based attacks are as follows-
1. Virus

It is a type of malicious software program that spread throughout the computer files without the knowledge of a user. It is a self-replicating malicious computer program that replicates by inserting copies of itself into other computer programs when executed. It can also execute instructions that cause harm to the system.

2. Worm

It is a type of malware whose primary function is to replicate itself to spread to uninfected computers. It works same as the computer virus. Worms often originate from email attachments that appear to be from trusted senders.

3. Trojan horse

It is a malicious program that occurs unexpected changes to computer setting and unusual activity, even when the computer should be idle. It misleads the user of its true intent. It appears to be a normal application but when opened/executed some malicious code will run in the background.

4. Backdoors

It is a method that bypasses the normal authentication process. A developer may create a backdoor so that an application or operating system can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes.

5. Bots

A bot (short for "robot") is an automated process that interacts with other network services. Some bots program run automatically, while others only execute commands when they receive specific input. Common examples of bots program are the crawler, chatroom bots, and malicious bots.


SOME TERMINOLOGY

some of the terminologies that we normally use hacking, hacking broadly speaking,
we use this term to refer to a process which involves some expertise. 

We expect the hackers to be expert in what they are doing. At times we also assume that hackers are more
intelligent in the persons, than the persons who are trying to protect the network. This
assumption is always safe to make that will make your network security better ok.

Cracking means breaching the security of a some kind of system, it can be software, it can
be hardware, computers, networks whatever, this is called cracking, you are trying to crack
a system. Spoofing is a kind of attack, where the person who is, who is attacking is trying
to falsify his or her identity. 

Suppose, I am trying to enter the system, but I am not telling who I am, I am telling I am Mr. X, Mr. X is somebody else right. So, it is the process of faking the originating address in a packet, a packet that flows in a network is sometimes
called a datagram ok. So, the address will not be my address, I will be changing the address
to somebody elseâ€™s address, so that the person who will be detecting that will believe that
someone else is trying to do whatever is being done ok.


Denial of service is another very important kind of an attack which often plagues or affects
systems or infrastructures. Well, here the idea is that one or a collection of computers or
routers or whatever you can say, a collection of nodes in the network, they can flood a
particular computer or host with enormous amount of network traffic. 

The idea is very simple, suppose I want to bring a particular server down, I will try to flood it with millions
and millions of packets, junk packets, so that the server will spend all of its time filtering
out those junk packets. So, whenever some legitimate requests are coming, valid packets
are coming, they will find that the service time is exceedingly slow, exceedingly long, 

this is something which is called denial of service.
And port scanning is a terminology which you use very frequently, well ports in a
computer system this we shall be discussing later. Ports indicate some entry points in the
system which connects the incoming connections to some programs or processes running
in the system. Say means in a computer system there can be multiple programs that are
running, and these programs can be associated with something called a port number ok.
Whenever you are trying to attack a system, normally the first step is to scan through some
dummy packets ping, these are called ping packets and try to find out which of the port
numbers in the system are active.


5
Suppose, you find out that there are four ports which are active then normally there is a
well documented hacking guideline which tells you that for these four ports what are the
known vulnerabilities and what are the best ways to attack or get entering those into the
system through these ports. So, this port scanning is the process of identifying which are
the active ports which are there and then searching for the corresponding vulnerabilities,
so that you can exploit them ok. These are called exploits, once you identify the ports you
try to find out an exploit through which you can get entry into the system, this is roughly
the idea. 

Now, talking about gaining access into the system, there are different ways in which you
can gain access to a system. One is you are entering the system through the front door. So,
the name is also given front door access. Normally, a system, normally I am talking about
whenever you try to access the system you try to log in, you are validated with respect to
some password or something similar to that.


So, passwords are the most common ways of gaining entry or access to a system in the
present day scenario ok. So, the first attempt through that front door channel will be to
guess valid password or try and steal some password. There are many methods that are
used for this purpose. During this course you will be seeing some of the tools through
which you can try and do this ok. This is the front door.

The second thing is a back door which normally a person coming is not able to see, but it
is there. Those of you who know there is a back door, they can only enter through that
back door. This is the basic idea. So, back doors are some you can say entry points to a
system which had deliberately kept by the developers. Well, I am giving an example
suppose I buy a router, a network router from some company, they give me some root
password and access rights, I change the root password. 

So, I am quite happy that means, I have sole access to it, I have changed the password, I am safe.
But sometimes it may happen if something goes down, the company might automatically
modify or configure, reconfigure the router through that back door. They will not even ask
you at times. They will automatically enter the router through that backdoor entry,

there will be some special password through which they can possibly enter and they can make
some changes inside. Such back doors are known to exist in many systems, not only
hardware systems also many of these software systems, software packages ok. Well,
usually developers keep it as debugging or diagnostic tools, but sometimes these are also
used for malicious purposes ok.


Then comes the Trojan horses. Now, if you remember the story of the Trojan horse where
it is something which was hidden inside a horse, some warriors were hidden inside a horse.
Suddenly some time one night, they just comes out and start creating havoc. Trojan horse
is also in terms of a computer system something very similar.

Here let us think of asoftware first. So, it is a software code that is hidden inside a larger software. Well, as a
user you are not even aware that such a Trojan is there inside the software ok.
Now, what happens sometimes that Trojan software can start running and can do lot of
malicious things in your system. For example, they can install some back doors through
which other persons or other packets can gain entry into your system. Nowadays, you will
also learn as part of the course later, Trojans can also exists in hardware. Whenever you
built a chip, you fabricate a chip, without your knowledge, some additional circuitry can
get fabricated which can allow unauthorized access or use of your chip, of your system
during its actual runtime ok.


And lastly come software vulnerabilities exploitation. Well, when a software is developed
by a company, that software is sold, with time some vulnerabilities might get detected
Normally, those vulnerabilities are published in the website of that company that well,


7

these are the vulnerabilities please install this patch to stop or overcome that vulnerability.
But everyone do not see that message and do not install the patch. But as a hacker if you
go there and see that well these are the vulnerabilities in that software, you try to find out
where all that software is installed and you try to break into those in using those vulnerable
points ok.


And this kind of software vulnerabilities are typically used, you can say as a playground
for the first time hackers. Sometimes they are called script kiddies. The hackers who are
just learning how to hack and that is the best place means already in some website it is
mentioned that these are the vulnerabilities, they just try to hack and see that whether they
are able to do it or not all right. 

Now, once a hacker gains access inside a system, there can be a number of things that can
be done. For example, every system usually has a log which monitors that who is logging
into the system at what time, what commands they are running and so on and so forth. So,
if the hacker gets into the system, the first thing he or she will possibly try to do is modify
the log, so that their tracks are erased.

So, if the system administrator looks at the log later on, they will not understand that well
an hacking actually happened or not. So, some entries in the log file can get deleted; can
be deleted, some files may be stolen, sometimes after stealing the files, files can be
destroyed also ok, some files might get modified, like you have heard of defacement of

8
websites, some hackers break into a website and change the contents of the page to
something malicious, so that people know that well we came here, we hacked your system,
just to cause mischief well.

Installing backdoors is more dangerous. So, you will not understand what has happened,
but someone has opened a back door through which anyone can enter into a system
whenever they want ok. And from your system, some other systems can be attacked.
Suppose in a network, there are 100 computers, someone gains entry into one of the
systems, one of the computers; from there the other 99 computers can be attacked if they
want to, right, ok.
